TestNg stands for test for next generation.

Test is used a unit test framework in the java based application.

it has inbuilt reporting feature.

it has self controlled annotation , which helps the user to cut down writting multiple line of code.

this testNg will works on top of annotions.

The annotation in the testNg are

@BeforeSuit
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterTest
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterSuit


Here suit is reffered as aset of test cases

@BeforeSuit:
What should i need to do vbefore my test execution(Batch execution) get started.

	---> Loading excel file
	---> Loading propertiesfiles
	---> Loading Extent Reports


Note:Before Suite will execute only once at the test execution level.

@Test:
As we have main method in java, in TestNG the starting execution trigger point is @Test.

only if we have @Test, then only , the test execution will be happened.

After the @Test annotation , method should be get followed.



Converting individual testcases into suite:
==========================================

1.Select all the testcases
2.RightClick--->TestNg-->ConverToTestNG
3.Xml File Willbe created


Executing test.xml:
===================
Select the testNg.xml 
Right click
run as TestNg




@AfterSuite:
This annotation is used to do the wrapup activities such like 
killing the driver object, publishing the test reports,
disconnecting the datatbases etc.

This annotation will aslo works only once in a while


@BeforeTest:

this annotation will execute before,for every <test> tag in the testng.xml

@AfterTest:

this annotation will execute after for every <test> tag in the testng.xml


@BeforeMethod

it will get executed before each method which is having @Test as an annotation.

Using @BeforeMethod  can i get the name of the testcase that is currently getting executed?

Yes. Using java reflections we can get teh name of the tset case easily.

But you must ensure that, name of the method is called as testcasename.
Not the classname
