Yes, you can by managing the window component of the browser

syntax: driverobject.manage().window().maximize();

viceversa:

How can i close the browser?

it can be done in two ways

	* using close() method
	* quit()

close it will close the currently opened browser
quit it willkill the driver object instance,
once you quit the driver object again you need to reintialize it.

if you use close, the driver object will be alive, but browser alone will get closed.
